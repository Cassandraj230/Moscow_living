# Moscow_living
 University of Idaho CS 360 Service Learning Project created by Cassandra Jensen and Shreeya Prahadan
Project ‘Moscow Living’ Installation and Use:
The link to the GitHub has all the source codes and the database export of the project. Once you pull the repositories, you will see different codes in the file. The index.php is the main page of the website. You can access other webpages only after you open this main page.

To run our project:
-Create a project in the chosen IDE (we used Netbeans) with all the files excluding the database info. 
-Use the xampp control panel to turn on the following modules; Apache and MySql so you can run the project locally. 
-Then use the database information file to copy over the SQL code into phpmyadmin to create the procedure and tables
-After you have the project files in Apache and the database tables and procedures uploaded you can run index.php in Apache and it should land you on the home page. 
-Our current project submission is not blank but instead filled with 'student data' to show how it would run.
